The goal of this lab is to familiarize students with essential electronic test equipment, including a digital multimeter, an oscilloscope, a function generator, and direct power supply. 
Understanding these instruments is critical for future experiments. 
Introduction of Summary: The purpose of this lab is to introduce students to key electronic test instruments. Gaining proficiency with these tools is essential for conducting future experiments effectively.
We performed various measurements using the provided equipment to verify component values and signal characteristics. Tasks include measuring resistances, capacitances, and voltage outputs, as well as analyzing waveforms using an oscilloscope.
Finally, we learned to use GitHub for collaboration and documentation.
By completing this lab, students gained hands-on experience in using electronic test instruments, verifying expected values against measured data, and analyzing discrepancies.
The exercise also introduced GitHub as a documentation and collaboration tool.
Discussion: Some measured values differed slightly from expected values due to instrument tolerances.
The oscilloscope provided more precise waveform measurements than the DMM.
The power supply's meter readings were close but not always exact compared to the DMM.
Function Generator and Oscilloscope Comparison:
Frequency and amplitude varied slightly across different measurement techniques.
The oscilloscopeâ€™s measurement feature provided the most accurate reading.
Impact of Equipment Accuracy:
Differences between instruments highlight the importance of calibration and understanding tool limitations.
Probe resistance must be accounted for when measuring low-resistance values.
Conclusion: This lab provided essential hands-on experience with electronic measurement instruments. We learned to verify component values, analyze signals, and compare measurements from different tools.
The experience with GitHub will facilitate effective collaboration and documentation for future labs. Understanding instrument limitations and proper measurement techniques is crucial for accurate electronic analysis.
